This is an incomplement Chip-8 emulator that I plan to integrate with opengl for rendering

## Planned Features
Sound fx

Freemove the window size

Key bindings

Controller input (maybe)

A menu bar with the following options:
- Select and load a program/game from a file
- Reset option
- Save states
- Load save states
- Select a color scheme (default white and black)
- ~~Ability maginify the resolution by 1x, 2x, 3x or 4x~~

Many of these menu options would be mapped to a key
